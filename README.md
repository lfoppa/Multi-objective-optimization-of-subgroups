# Multi-objective-optimization-of-subgroups

This repository contains supporting information related to the publication "Coherent Collections of Rules Describing Exceptional Materials Identified with a Multi-Objective Optimization of Subgroups", available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18437.

The "data" folder contains the datasets used to train subgroup discovery, the list of materials candidates used for screening, and the results of the density-functional-theory calculations used to verify the results of the screening. 

The "output" folder contains the output files of subgroug discovery that were used in the publication.

The "notebook.ipynb" jupyter notebook generates the input files of subgroup discovery and analyzes the results. This notebook can be used to generate the figures of the publication and it can be modified to produce new subgroup-discovery analysis. 

The subgroup-discovery analysis is performed using the realKD code, which is available at https://bitbucket.org/realKD/realkd/wiki/Home.
